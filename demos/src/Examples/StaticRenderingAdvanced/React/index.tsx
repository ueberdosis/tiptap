/**
 * This example demonstrates how to render a Prosemirror Node (or JSON Content) to a React Element.
 * It will use your extensions to render the content based on each Node's/Mark's `renderHTML` method.
 * This can be useful if you want to render content to React without having an actual editor instance.
 *
 * You have complete control over the rendering process. And can replace how each Node/Mark is rendered.
