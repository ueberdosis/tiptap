tiptap is a headless wrapper around [ProseMirror](https://ProseMirror.net) – a toolkit for building rich text WYSIWYG editors, which is already in use at many well-known companies such as *New York Times*, *The Guardian* or *Atlassian*.

Create exactly the rich text editor you want out of customizable building blocks. Tiptap comes with sensible defaults, a lot of extensions and a friendly API to customize every aspect. It’s backed by a welcoming community, open source, and free.

## What does “headless” mean?
There is no provided user interface, you are absolutely free to build whatever interface you want. No need to overwrite any class, to use `!important` or other hacks, just write whatever you like in the setup you are used to.

## Why should I use Tiptap?
[ProseMirror](https://ProseMirror.net) is a well-written, reliable and very powerful editor toolkit. It’s not so much the ready-to-use editor most people look for, but with Tiptap you can start in minutes, choose from tons of amazing extensions and still have that powerful ProseMirror API accessible when you really need it.
