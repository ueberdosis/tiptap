## Vanilla JavaScript
You are using plain JavaScript or a framework that is not listed here? No worries, we provide everything you need.

### 1. Install the dependencies
For the following example you will need `@tiptap/core` (the actual editor) and `@tiptap/starter-kit`.

The StarterKit doesn’t include all, but the most common extensions.

```bash
npm install @tiptap/core @tiptap/starter-kit
```

### 2. Add some markup
Add the following HTML where you want the editor to be mounted:

```html
<div class="element"></div>
```

### 3. Initialize the editor
Everything is in place now, so let’s set up the actual editor now. Add the following code to your JavaScript:

```js
import { Editor } from '@tiptap/core'
import StarterKit from '@tiptap/starter-kit'

new Editor({
  element: document.querySelector('.element'),
  extensions: [
    StarterKit,
  ],
  content: '<p>Hello World!</p>',
})
```

Open your project in the browser to see Tiptap in action. Good work!
