# Installation

## Introduction

Tiptap is framework-agnostic and even works with Vanilla JavaScript (if thatâ€™s your thing). The following integration guides help you integrating Tiptap in your JavaScript project.

## Base Setup

To get started you will need to install `@tiptap/core`, `@tiptap/pm` and `@tiptap/starter-kit` in your project like this:

```bash
npm install @tiptap/core @tiptap/pm @tiptap/starter-kit
```

After that, you can start using Tiptap in your project. To integrate it into your framework, please follow the guides below.
