The `Text` extension is required, at least if you want to work with text of any kind and that’s very likely. This extension is a little bit different, it doesn’t even render HTML. It’s plain text, that’s all.

<Callout title="Breaking Change" variant="info">
  Tiptap v1 tried to hide that node from you, but it has always been there. You have to explicitly
  import it from now on (or use [StarterKit](/editor/extensions/functionality/starterkit)).
</Callout>

<CodeDemo path="/Nodes/Text" />
