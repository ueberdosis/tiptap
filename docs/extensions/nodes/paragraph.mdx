Yes, the schema is very strict. Without this extension you wonâ€™t even be able to use paragraphs in the editor.

<Callout title="Breaking Change" variant="warning">
  Tiptap v1 tried to hide that node from you, but it has always been there. You have to explicitly
  import it from now on (or use [StarterKit](/editor/extensions/functionality/starterkit)).
</Callout>

<CodeDemo path="/Nodes/Paragraph" />
