Honestly, the mention node is amazing. It adds support for `@mentions`, for example to ping users, _and_ provides full control over the rendering.

Literally everything can be customized. You can pass a custom component for the rendering. All examples use `.filter()` to search through items, but feel free to send async queries to an API or add a more advanced library like [fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) to your project.

<CodeDemo path="/Nodes/Mention" />

## Install

```bash
npm install @tiptap/extension-mention
```

## Dependencies

To place the popups correctly, we’re using [tippy.js](https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/) in all our examples. You are free to bring your own library, but if you’re fine with it, just install what we use:

```bash
npm install tippy.js
```

Since 2.0.0-beta.193 we marked the `@tiptap/suggestion` as a peer dependency. That means, you will need to install it manually.

```bash
npm install @tiptap/suggestion
```

## Settings

### HTMLAttributes

Custom HTML attributes that should be added to the rendered HTML tag.

```js
Mention.configure({
  HTMLAttributes: {
    class: 'my-custom-class',
  },
})
```

### renderText

Define how a mention text should be rendered.

```js
Mention.configure({
  renderText({ options, node }) {
    return `${options.suggestion.char}${node.attrs.label ?? node.attrs.id}`
  },
})
```

### renderHTML

Define how a mention html element should be rendered, this is useful if you want to render an element other than `span` (e.g `a`)

```js
Mention.configure({
  renderHTML({ options, node }) {
    return [
      'a',
      mergeAttributes({ href: '/profile/1' }, options.HTMLAttributes),
      `${options.suggestion.char}${node.attrs.label ?? node.attrs.id}`,
    ]
  },
})
```

### deleteTriggerWithBackspace

Toggle whether the suggestion character(s) should also be deleted on deletion of a mention node. Default is `false`.

```js
Mention.configure({
  deleteTriggerWithBackspace: true,
})
```

### suggestion

Options for the Suggestion utility. Used to define what character triggers the suggestion popup, among other parameters. [Read more](/editor/api/utilities/suggestion).

```js
Mention.configure({
  suggestion: {
    // …
  },
})
```

### suggestions

Allows you to define multiple types of mentions within the same editor. For example, define a mention for people with the `@` trigger and one for movies with the `#` trigger. [Read more about the Suggestion utility](/editor/api/utilities/suggestion).

```js
Mention.configure({
  suggestions: [
    {
      char: '@',
      // Other options of the Suggestion utility
    },
    {
      char: '#',
      // Other options of the Suggestion utility
    },
  ],
})
```
