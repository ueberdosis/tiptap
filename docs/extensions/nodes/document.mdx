The `Document` extension is required, no matter what you build with Tiptap. It’s a so called “topNode”, a node that’s the home to all other nodes. Think of it like the `<body>` tag for your document.

The node is very tiny though. It defines a name of the node (`doc`), is configured to be a top node (`topNode: true`) and that it can contain multiple other nodes (`block+`). That’s all. But have a look yourself:

<CodeDemo path="/Nodes/Document" />

<Callout title="Breaking Change" variant="warning">
  Tiptap v1 tried to hide that node from you, but it has always been there. You have to explicitly
  import it from now on (or use [StarterKit](/editor/extensions/functionality/starterkit)).
</Callout>

## Install

```bash
npm install @tiptap/extension-document
