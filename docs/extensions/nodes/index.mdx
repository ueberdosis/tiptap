If you think of the document as a tree, then nodes are just a type of content in that tree. Examples of nodes are paragraphs, headings, or code blocks. But nodes donâ€™t have to be blocks. They can also be rendered inline with the text, for example for @mentions.

<Extensions path="content/editor/extensions/nodes" />
