import { Callout } from '@/components/ui/Callout'

The power of Tiptap lies in its flexibility. You can create your own extensions from scratch and build a unique editor experience tailored to your needs.

## Creating a mark

Marks are used to add inline formatting to text in Tiptap. Common examples include bold, italic, and underline formatting.

They extend all of the options and methods from the [Extension API](/editor/extensions/custom-extensions/extension) and add a few more specific to marks.

Let's add a simple mark extension to see how it works.

```typescript
import { Mark } from '@tiptap/core'

const HighlightMark = Mark.create({
  name: 'highlight',

  addOptions() {
    return {
      HTMLAttributes: {},
    }
  },

  parseHTML() {
    return [
      {
        tag: 'mark',
      },
    ]
  },

  renderHTML({ HTMLAttributes }) {
    return ['mark', HTMLAttributes, 0]
  },
})
```

You can also use a callback function to create a mark. This is useful if you want to encapsulate the logic of your extension, for example when you want to define event handlers or other custom logic.

```js
import { Mark } from '@tiptap/core'

const CustomMark = Mark.create(() => {
  // Define variables or functions to use inside your extension
  const customVariable = 'foo'

  function onCreate() {}
  function onUpdate() {}

  return {
    name: 'customMark',
    onCreate,
    onUpdate,

    // Your code goes here.
  }
})
```

This code creates a new mark extension named `HighlightMark`. It adds an `addOptions` method to define the mark's options, which are configurable by the user. It also adds `parseHTML` and `renderHTML` methods to define how the mark is parsed and rendered as HTML.

It is installed to the editor just like any other extension by adding it to the `extensions` array.

```typescript
import { Editor } from '@tiptap/core'

new Editor({
  extensions: [HighlightMark],
})

// Or if using React or Vue

const editor = useEditor({
  extensions: [HighlightMark],
})
```

Now let's take a closer look at the options and methods available for marks.

## Mark options

When creating a mark extension, you can define options that are configurable by the user. These options can be used to customize the behavior or appearance of the mark.

### `parseHTML`

The `parseHTML` method is used to define how the mark is parsed from HTML. It should return an array of objects representing the mark's attributes.

Maps to the `parseDOM` attribute in [the ProseMirror schema](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#model.MarkSpec.parseDOM).

```typescript
const CustomMark = Mark.create({
  name: 'customMark',

  parseHTML() {
    return [
      {
        tag: 'span',
        getAttrs: (node) => {
          return {
            class: node.getAttribute('class'),
          }
        },
      },
    ]
  },
})
```

This will be used during paste events to parse the HTML content into a mark.

### `renderHTML`

The `renderHTML` method is used to define how the mark is rendered as HTML. It should return an array representing the mark's HTML representation.

Maps to the `toDOM` attribute in [the ProseMirror schema](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#model.MarkSpec.toDOM).

```typescript
const CustomMark = Mark.create({
  name: 'customMark',

  renderHTML({ HTMLAttributes }) {
    return ['span', HTMLAttributes, 0]
  },
})
```

This will be used during copy events to render the mark as HTML. For more details, see the [extend existing extensions](/editor/extensions/custom-extensions/extend-existing#render-html) guide.

### `addAttributes`

The `addAttributes` method is used to define custom attributes for the mark. It should return an object with the attribute names and their default values.

Maps to the `attrs` attribute in [the ProseMirror schema](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#model.MarkSpec.attrs).

```typescript
const CustomMark = Mark.create({
  name: 'customMark',

  addAttributes() {
    return {
      customAttribute: {
        default: 'value',
        parseHTML: (element) => element.getAttribute('data-custom-attribute'),
      },
    }
  },
})
```

For more details, see the [extend existing extensions](/editor/extensions/custom-extensions/extend-existing#rattributes) guide.

### `keepOnSplit`

By default, when a node is split, marks are removed from the content. You can set `keepOnSplit` to `true` to keep the mark on the new node.

```typescript
const CustomMark = Mark.create({
  name: 'customMark',

  keepOnSplit: true,
})
```

### `inclusive`

By default, marks are not inclusive, meaning they cannot be applied to the start or end of a node. You can set `inclusive` to `true` to allow the mark to be applied to the start or end of a node.

Maps to the `inclusive` attribute in [the ProseMirror schema](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#model.MarkSpec.inclusive).

```typescript
const CustomMark = Mark.create({
  name: 'customMark',

  inclusive: true,
})
```

### `excludes`

By default, marks do not exclude other marks. You can define a list of marks that should be excluded when this mark is applied.

Maps to the `excludes` attribute in [the ProseMirror schema](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#model.MarkSpec.excludes).

```typescript
const CustomMark = Mark.create({
  name: 'customMark',

  excludes: ['bold', 'italic'],
})
```

### `exitable`

By default, marks are not exitable, meaning they cannot be removed by pressing backspace at the start of the mark. You can set `exitable` to `true` to allow the mark to be removed in this way.

Maps to the `exitable` attribute in [the ProseMirror schema](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#model.MarkSpec.exitable).

```typescript
const CustomMark = Mark.create({
  name: 'customMark',

  exitable: true,
})
```

### `group`

By default, marks are not grouped, meaning they are applied individually. You can define a group for the mark to ensure that only one mark from the group can be applied at a time.

Maps to the `group` attribute in [the ProseMirror schema](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#model.MarkSpec.group).

```typescript
const CustomMark = Mark.create({
  name: 'customMark',

  group: 'textStyle',
})
```

### `spanning`

By default, marks do not span multiple nodes. You can set `spanning` to `true` to allow the mark to span multiple nodes.

Maps to the `spanning` attribute in [the ProseMirror schema](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#model.MarkSpec.spanning).

```typescript
const CustomMark = Mark.create({
  name: 'customMark',

  spanning: true,
})
```

### `code`

By default, marks are not treated as code marks. You can set `code` to `true` to treat the mark as a code mark.

Maps to the `code` attribute in [the ProseMirror schema](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#model.MarkSpec.code).

```typescript
const CustomMark = Mark.create({
  name: 'customMark',

  code: true,
})
```
