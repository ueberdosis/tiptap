import { CodeDemo } from '@/components/CodeDemo'

Using frameworks like Vue or React can feel too complex, if you’re used to work without those two. Good news: You can use Vanilla JavaScript in your mark views. There is just a little bit you need to know, but let’s go through this one by one.

## Render a mark view with JavaScript

Here is what you need to do to render a mark view inside your editor:

1. [Create a mark extension](/editor/extensions/custom-extensions/create-new/mark)
2. Register a new mark view with `addMarkView()`
3. Write your render function
4. [Configure Tiptap to use your new mark extension](/editor/getting-started/configure)

This is how your mark extension could look like:

```ts
import { Mark } from '@tiptap/core'

export default Mark.create({
  // Other options...
  addMarkView() {
    return ({ mark, HTMLAttributes }) => {
      const dom = document.createElement('b')
      const contentDOM = document.createElement('span')

      dom.appendChild(contentDOM)

      return {
        dom,
        contentDOM,
      }
    }
  },
})
```

Got it? Let’s see it in action. Feel free to copy the below example to get started.

That mark view even interacts with the editor. Time to see how that is wired up.

## Access mark attributes

The editor passes a few helpful things to your render function. One of them is the `mark` prop. This one enables you to access mark attributes in your mark view. Let’s say you have [added an attribute](/editor/extensions/custom-extensions/extend-existing#attributes) named `color` to your mark extension. You could access the attribute like this:

```ts
addMarkView() {
  return ({ mark }) => {
    console.log(mark.attrs.color)
  }
}
```

## Adding a content editable

A mark is wrapping a part of the text in the editor. If you want to make the content of the mark editable, you can add the `contenteditable` attribute to the `contentDOM` element.

```ts
addMarkView() {
  return ({ mark, HTMLAttributes }) => {
    const dom = document.createElement('b')
    const contentDOM = document.createElement('span')

    contentDOM.contentEditable = 'true'
    dom.appendChild(contentDOM)

    return {
      dom,
      contentDOM,
    }
  }
}
```

Got it? You’re free to do anything you like, as long as you return a container for the mark view and another one for the content.

## Updating mark view attributes

If you want to update the attributes of your mark view, you can call the `updateAttributes` method on the MarkView instance.

```ts
markView.updateAttributes({
  id: 'new-id',
  color: 'blue',
})
```
