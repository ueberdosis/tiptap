### Disabling rules

You can configure the included rules, or even disable a few of them, like shown below.

```js
import { Editor } from '@tiptap/core'
import Typography from '@tiptap/extension-typography'

const editor = new Editor({
  extensions: [
    // Disable some included rules
    Typography.configure({
      oneHalf: false,
      oneQuarter: false,
      threeQuarters: false,
    }),
  ],
})
```

### Overriding rules

You can override the output of a rule by passing a string to the option you want to override.

```js
import { Editor } from '@tiptap/core'
import Typography from '@tiptap/extension-typography'

const editor = new Editor({
  extensions: [
    // Disable some included rules
    Typography.configure({
      oneHalf: '1 / 2', // this will insert "1 / 2" instead of the default "½"
    }),
  ],
})
```
