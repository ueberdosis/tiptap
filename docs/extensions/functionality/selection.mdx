import { CodeDemo } from '@/components/CodeDemo'

The Selection extension adds a CSS class to the current selection when the editor is blurred. By default it adds `.selection`, but you can change that.

Note that itâ€™s only a class, the styling is totally up to you. The usage example below has some CSS for that class.

<CodeDemo path="/Extensions/Selection" />

## Install

```bash
npm install @tiptap/extensions
```

And import it in your editor:

```ts
import { Editor } from '@tiptap/core'
import { Selection } from '@tiptap/extensions'

new Editor({
  extensions: [Selection],
})
```

## Settings

### className

The class that is applied to the focused element.

Default: `'has-focus'`

```js
Focus.configure({
  className: 'focus',
})
```
