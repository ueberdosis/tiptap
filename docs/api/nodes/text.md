# Text
[![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@tiptap/extension-text.svg?label=version)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tiptap/extension-text)
[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/@tiptap/extension-text.svg)](https://npmcharts.com/compare/@tiptap/extension-text?minimal=true)

**The `Text` extension is required**, at least if you want to work with text of any kind and that’s very likely. This extension is a little bit different, it doesn’t even render HTML. It’s plain text, that’s all.

:::warning Breaking Change from 1.x → 2.x
Tiptap 1 tried to hide that node from you, but it has always been there. You have to explicitly import it from now on (or use `StarterKit`).
