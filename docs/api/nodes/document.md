# Document
[![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@tiptap/extension-document.svg?label=version)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tiptap/extension-document)

**The `Document` extension is required**, no matter what you build with Tiptap. It’s a so called “topNode”, a node that’s the home to all other nodes. Think of it like the `<body>` tag for your document.

The node is very tiny though. It defines a name of the node (`doc`), is configured to be a top node (`topNode: true`) and that it can contain multiple other nodes (`block+`). That’s all. But have a look yourself:

:::warning Breaking Change from 1.x → 2.x
Tiptap 1 tried to hide that node from you, but it has always been there. You have to explicitly import it from now on (or use `StarterKit`).
