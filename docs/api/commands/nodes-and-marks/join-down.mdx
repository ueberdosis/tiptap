The `joinDown` command joins the selected block, or if there is a text selection, the closest ancestor block of the selection that can be joined, with the sibling below it. [See also](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#commands.joinDown)

## Use the joinDown command

```js
editor.commands.joinDown()
```
