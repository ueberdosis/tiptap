Tiptap provides commands to manipulate nodes and marks easily.

Nodes and marks are the building blocks of your Tiptap editor. Nodes represent content elements like paragraphs, headings, or images, while marks provide inline formatting, such as bold, italic, or links.

## Use Cases

- **Creating New Nodes:** Use [`createParagraphNear`](/editor/api/commands/nodes-and-marks/create-paragraph-near) or [`splitBlock`](/editor/api/commands/nodes-and-marks/split-block) to add new nodes near the selection.
- **Managing Node Structures:** Update, replace, or lift nodes using commands like [`setNode`](/editor/api/commands/nodes-and-marks/set-node), [`lift`](/editor/api/commands/nodes-and-marks/lift), or [`toggleNode`](/editor/api/commands/nodes-and-marks/toggle-node).
- **Mark Manipulation:** Toggle, set, or unset marks using commands like [`toggleMark`](/editor/api/commands/nodes-and-marks/toggle-mark), [`setMark`](/editor/api/commands/nodes-and-marks/set-mark), or [`unsetMark`](/editor/api/commands/nodes-and-marks/unset-mark).
- **Content Cleanup:** Remove unwanted marks or nodes using [`clearNodes`](/editor/api/commands/nodes-and-marks/clear-nodes), [`unsetAllMarks`](/editor/api/commands/nodes-and-marks/unset-all-marks), or [`resetAttributes`](/editor/api/commands/nodes-and-marks/reset-attributes).
