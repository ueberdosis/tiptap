The `joinForward` command joins two nodes forwards from the current selection. If the selection is empty and at the end of a textblock, `joinForward` will try to reduce the distance between that block and the block after it. [See also](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#commands.joinForward)

## Use the joinForward command

```js
editor.commands.joinForward()
```
