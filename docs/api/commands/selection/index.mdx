The Tiptap editor provides editor commands for managing selection and focus within your documents. Hereâ€™s an overview of the essential selection commands that help you manage cursor movement, selections, and focus behavior.

## Use Cases

- **Managing Focus and Blur:** Control focus behavior using [`focus`](/editor/api/commands/selection/focus) and [`blur`](/editor/api/commands/selection/blur).
- **Deleting and Selecting Content:** Use commands like [`deleteSelection`](/editor/api/commands/selection/delete-selection) and [`selectAll`](/editor/api/commands/selection/select-all) to efficiently manage content.
- **Navigating the Document:** Scroll to a specific position or node using [`scrollIntoView`](/editor/api/commands/selection/scroll-into-view) and select specific nodes with [`selectNodeBackward`](/editor/api/commands/selection/select-node-backward), [`selectNodeForward`](/editor/api/commands/selection/select-node-forward), or [`selectParentNode`](/editor/api/commands/selection/select-parent-node).
