The `clearContent` command deletes the current document. The editor will maintain at least one empty paragraph due to schema requirements.

See also: [setContent](/editor/api/commands/content/set-content), [insertContent](/editor/api/commands/content/insert-content)

## Parameters

`emitUpdate?: boolean (true)`
Whether to emit an update event. Defaults to `true` (Note: This changed from `false` in v2).

## Examples

```js
// Clear content (emits update event by default)
editor.commands.clearContent()

// Clear content without emitting update
editor.commands.clearContent(false)
```
