## Exiting open suggestions

Sometimes you want your users to be able to exit an an open suggestion without selecting an item. To achieve this, users can either press Escape which will close the open suggestion.
If you want to manually trigger the closing of the suggestion, you can use use `exitSuggestion` utility function to close existing suggestions on your view.
v
```js
import { exitSuggestion } from '@tiptap/suggestion'
import { PluginKey } from 'prosemirror-state' // optional, if you need to create a custom key

const MySuggestionPluginKey = new PluginKey('my-suggestions') // or use the default 'suggestion'

exitSuggestion(editor.view, MySuggestionPluginKey)

// Alternatively, use the default plugin key:
// exitSuggestion(editor.iew, 'suggestion')
```
