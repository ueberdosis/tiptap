import { CodeDemo } from '@/components/CodeDemo'

When creating custom extensions, you often have to define how they should be rendered to HTML. Usually, this is done by defining a `renderHTML` function that returns Prosemirror render array including the tag name, attributes and content holes.

With the Tiptap JSX renderer, you can use JSX to define how your extensions should be rendered.

<CodeDemo path="/Examples/JSX" />

## Using JSX in your extension

To use JSX in your extension, you will need a bundler that can handle **JSX** or **TSX** files like Vite or Webpack. Most frameworks like Next.js, Remix or Nuxt already should be able to handle this.

By default, the JSX runtime of React is used if not configured otherwise. This will cause issues if you are trying to use JSX in a non-React environment like a Tiptap extension.

To handle this, you can add a comment to the top of your file to specify which JSX runtime the bundler should use. Tiptap comes with it's own bundler from `@tiptap/core`.

```jsx
/** @jsxImportSource @tiptap/core */

// your code here
```

## Writing JSX in the `renderHTML` function

Now that the bundler should be able to handle JSX for Tiptap, you can use JSX in your `renderHTML` function.

```jsx
/** @jsxImportSource @tiptap/core */

import { Node } from '@tiptap/core'

const MyNode = Node.create({
  // ... your node configuration

  renderHTML({ HTMLAttributes }) {
    return (
      <div {...HTMLAttributes}>
        <p>This is your custom node. And here is your content hole:</p>
        <slot />
      </div>
    )
  }
})
```

The `<slot />` tag is used to define a content hole for Prosemirror via JSX. This is the position your editable content will be rendered into.

**Note** that this is not using any component library like React or Vue under the hood and won't support hooks, states or other library specific features.
