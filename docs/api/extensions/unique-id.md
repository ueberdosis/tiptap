# UniqueId
The `UniqueId` extension adds unique IDs to all nodes. The extension keeps track of your nodes, even if you split them, merge them, undo/redo changes, crop content, paste content … It just works.

Also, you can configure which node types get an unique ID, and which not, and you can customize how those IDs are generated.
