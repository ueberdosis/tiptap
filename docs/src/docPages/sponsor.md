## The maintainers of tiptap
If you’re thankful for tiptap, you should say thank you to all 12 lovely people of [überdosis](https://twitter.com/_ueberdosis). The amazing company we’re all building together and the amazing company that funded the initial development costs of tiptap 2.

AND you should definitely hire us if you want us to design und build an amazing digital product for you. Bonus points if it’s somehow text editing related.

But here are the friendly faces of the two maintainer of tiptap, Philipp Kühn (left) and Hans Pagel (right). You’ve probably read our names in the thousands of commits, pull requests or Tweets already.
