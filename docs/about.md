# About the project

## Introduction
To deliver a top-notch developer experience and user experience, we put ~~hundreds~~ thousands of hours of unpaid work into Tiptap. Your funding helps us to make this work more and more financially sustainable. This enables us to provide helpful support, maintain all our packages, keep everything up to date, and develop new features and extensions for Tiptap.

Give back to the open source community and [sponsor us on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/ueberdosis)! ♥

## More peace of mind
Companies betting on Tiptap probably want some peace of mind and ensure that we keep maintaining Tiptap, but don’t forget that our work is based on the work of other lovely people that you should definitely sponsor too:

## Frequently asked questions

### I can’t use GitHub. How can I support you?
If you’re a company, don’t want to use GitHub, don’t have a credit card or want a proper invoice from us, just reach out to us at [humans@tiptap.dev](mailto:humans@tiptap.dev).

We have an [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/tiptap), which allows you to send money through transfer, PayPal or credit card. Donations are tax deductible for US companies.

### I want consulting. What’s your rate?
If you have an issue, a question, want to talk something through or anything else, [please use GitHub issues](https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap/issues/new/choose) to keep everything accessible to the whole community. For everything else, reach out to [humans@tiptap.dev](mailto:humans@tiptap.dev). We can take on a limited number of custom development and consulting contracts.

### Can we have a call?
Nope, we are big fans of asynchronous communication. If you really need to reach out in private, send us an email to [humans@tiptap.dev](mailto:humans@tiptap.dev), but don’t expect technical email support. That all happens on [GitHub](https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap/issues)


## P.S. Did you know, we’re also into realtime text editing?

With [Collaboration](https://tiptap.dev/collab) we  built a realtime backend for conflict-free text editing. And the best part: Integration into Tiptap is just a few clicks away.
