## The maintainers of Tiptap
If you are thankful for Tiptap, you should say thank you to the lovely people at [Ã¼berdosis](https://ueberdosis.io), the company that builds this software.

AND you should definitely hire us if you want us to design und build an amazing digital product for you. Bonus points if itâ€™s somehow text editing related.

## Frequently asked questions

### I canâ€™t use GitHub. How can I support you?
If youâ€™re a company, donâ€™t want to use GitHub, donâ€™t have a credit card or want a proper invoice from us, just reach out to us at [humans@tiptap.dev](mailto:humans@tiptap.dev).

We are part of the [Y-Collective](https://opencollective.com/y-collective), a fund for projects related to Y.js (the technology weâ€™re using for all the collaborative editing magic). Thatâ€™s an OpenCollective, which allows you to send money through transfer, PayPal or credit card. Donations are tax deductible for US companies.

### I want consulting. Whatâ€™s your rate?
If you have an issue, a question, want to talk something through or anything else, [please use GitHub issues](https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap/issues/new/choose) to keep everything accessible to the whole community. For everything else, reach out to [humans@tiptap.dev](mailto:humans@tiptap.dev). We can take on a limited number of custom development and consulting contracts.

### Can we have a call?
Nope, we are big fans of asynchronous communication. If you really need to reach out in private, send us an email to [humans@tiptap.dev](mailto:humans@tiptap.dev), but donâ€™t expect technical email support. That all happens on [GitHub](https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap/issues)
