Discover how to integrate Tiptap with your Vue 3 project using this step-by-step guide. Alternatively, check out our [Vue text editor example](/examples/basics/default-text-editor).

### Requirements

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your machine
- [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) installed on your machine
- Experience with [Vue](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html)

## Create a project (optional)

If you already have a Vue project, that's fine too. Just skip this step.

For the purpose of this guide, start with a fresh Vue project called `my-tiptap-project`. The Vue CLI sets up everything we need. Just select the Vue 3 template.

```bash
# create a project
vue create my-tiptap-project

# change directory
cd my-tiptap-project
```

### Install the dependencies

Okay, enough boilerplate work. Let's finally install Tiptap! For the following example, you'll need the `@tiptap/vue-3` package, `@tiptap/pm` (the ProseMirror library), and `@tiptap/starter-kit`, which includes the most common extensions to get started quickly.

```bash
npm install @tiptap/vue-3 @tiptap/pm @tiptap/starter-kit
```

If you followed steps 1 and 2, you can now start your project with `npm run dev` and open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your favorite browser. This might be different if you're working with an existing project.

## Integrate Tiptap

To start using Tiptap, you'll need to add a new component to your app. Let's call it `Tiptap` and put the following example code in `components/Tiptap.vue`.

This is the fastest way to get Tiptap up and running with Vue. It will give you a very basic version of Tiptap, without any buttons. No worries, you will be able to add more functionality soon.

```html
<template>
  <editor-content :editor="editor" />
</template>

<script>
  import { Editor, EditorContent } from '@tiptap/vue-3'
  import StarterKit from '@tiptap/starter-kit'

  export default {
    components: {
      EditorContent,
    },

    data() {
      return {
        editor: null,
      }
    },

    mounted() {
      this.editor = new Editor({
        content: "<p>I'm running Tiptap with Vue.js. ðŸŽ‰</p>",
        extensions: [StarterKit],
      })
    },

    beforeUnmount() {
      this.editor.destroy()
    },
  }
</script>
```

Alternatively, you can use the Composition API with the `useEditor` method.

```html
<template>
  <editor-content :editor="editor" />
</template>

<script>
  import { useEditor, EditorContent } from '@tiptap/vue-3'
  import StarterKit from '@tiptap/starter-kit'

  export default {
    components: {
      EditorContent,
    },

    setup() {
      const editor = useEditor({
        content: "<p>I'm running Tiptap with Vue.js. ðŸŽ‰</p>",
        extensions: [StarterKit],
      })

      return { editor }
    },
  }
</script>
```

Or feel free to use the new [`<script setup>` syntax](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html).

```html
<template>
  <editor-content :editor="editor" />
</template>

<script setup>
  import { useEditor, EditorContent } from '@tiptap/vue-3'
  import StarterKit from '@tiptap/starter-kit'

  const editor = useEditor({
    content: "<p>I'm running Tiptap with Vue.js. ðŸŽ‰</p>",
    extensions: [StarterKit],
  })
</script>
```

### Add it to your app

Now, let's replace the content of `src/App.vue` with the following example code to use our new `Tiptap` component in our app.

```html
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <tiptap />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  import Tiptap from './components/Tiptap.vue'

  export default {
    name: 'App',
    components: {
      Tiptap,
    },
  }
</script>
```

You should now see Tiptap in your browser. Time to give yourself a pat on the back! :)

### Use v-model (optional)

You're probably used to binding your data with `v-model` in forms, that's also possible with Tiptap. Here is how that would work with Tiptap:

<CodeDemo path="/GuideGettingStarted/VModel" />
