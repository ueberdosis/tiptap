import { Callout } from '@/components/ui/Callout'

You can use Tiptap with Laravel, Livewire, Inertia.js, Alpine.js, Tailwind CSS, and even—yes, you read that right—inside PHP.

We provide [an official PHP package to work with Tiptap content](/editor/api/utilities/tiptap-for-php). You can transform Tiptap-compatible JSON to HTML and vice versa, sanitize your content, or just modify it.

## Laravel Livewire

### my-livewire-component.blade.php

```html
<!--
  In your livewire component you could add an
  autosave method to handle saving the content
  from the editor every 10 seconds if you wanted
-->
<x-editor wire:model="foo" wire:poll.10000ms="autosave"></x-editor>
```

<Callout variant="default" title="Hint">

    The `.defer` modifier is no longer available in Livewire v3, as updating the state is deferred by default. Use the `.live` modifier if you need to update the state server-side, as it changes.

</Callout>

### editor.blade.php

```html
<div
  x-data="setupEditor(
    $wire.entangle('{{ $attributes->wire('model')->value() }}').defer
  )"
  x-init="() => init($refs.editor)"
  wire:ignore
  {{ $attributes->whereDoesntStartWith('wire:model') }}
>
  <div x-ref="editor"></div>
</div>
```

### index.js

```js
import { Editor } from '@tiptap/core'
import StarterKit from '@tiptap/starter-kit'

window.setupEditor = function (content) {
  let editor

  return {
    content: content,

    init(element) {
      editor = new Editor({
        element: element,
        extensions: [StarterKit],
        content: this.content,
        onUpdate: ({ editor }) => {
          this.content = editor.getHTML()
        },
      })

      this.$watch('content', (content) => {
        // If the new content matches Tiptap's then we just skip.
        if (content === editor.getHTML()) return

        /*
          Otherwise, it means that an external source
          is modifying the data on this Alpine component,
          which could be Livewire itself.
          In this case, we only need to update Tiptap's
          content and we're done.
          For more information on the `setContent()` method, see:
            https://www.tiptap.dev/api/commands/set-content
        */
        editor.commands.setContent(content, false)
      })
    },
  }
}
```
