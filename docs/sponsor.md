## The maintainers of tiptap
If you are thankful for tiptap, you should say thank you to the lovely people of [Ã¼berdosis](https://ueberdosis.io). The amazing company we are all building together and the amazing company that funded the initial development costs of tiptap.

AND you should definitely hire us if you want us to design und build an amazing digital product for you. Bonus points if itâ€™s somehow text editing related.

But here are the friendly faces of the two maintainers of tiptap, Philipp KÃ¼hn (left) and Hans Pagel (right). Youâ€™ve probably read our names in the thousands of commits, pull requests or Tweets already.

## Frequently asked questions

### I canâ€™t use GitHub. How can I support you?
If youâ€™re a company, donâ€™t want to use GitHub, donâ€™t have a credit card or want a proper invoice from us, just reach out to us at [humans@tiptap.dev](mailto:humans@tiptap.dev).

We are part of the [Y-Collective](https://opencollective.com/y-collective), a fund for projects related to Y.js (the technology weâ€™re using for all the collaborative editing magic). Thatâ€™s an OpenCollective, which allows you to send money through transfer, PayPal or credit card. Donations are tax deductible for US companies.

### I want consulting. Whatâ€™s your rate?
If you have an issue, a question, want to talk something through or anything else, [please use GitHub issues](https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap/issues/new/choose) to keep everything accessible to the whole community. For everything else, reach out to [humans@tiptap.dev](mailto:humans@tiptap.dev). We can take on a limited number of custom development and consulting contracts.

### Can we have a call?
Nope, we are big fans of asynchronous communication. If you really need to reach out in private, send us an email to [humans@tiptap.dev](mailto:humans@tiptap.dev), but donâ€™t expect technical email support. That all happens on [GitHub](https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap/issues).
