## Structure

ProseMirror works with a strict [Schema](/editor/core-concepts/schema), which defines the allowed structure of a document. A document is a tree of headings, paragraphs and others elements, so called nodes. Marks can be attached to a node, e. g. to emphasize part of it. [Commands](/editor/api/commands) change that document programmatically.

## Content

The document is stored in a state. All changes are applied as transactions to the state. The state has details about the current content, cursor position and selection. You can hook into a few different [events](/editor/api/events), for example to alter transactions before they get applied.

## Extensions

Extensions add [nodes](/editor/extensions/nodes), [marks](/editor/extensions/marks) and/or [functionalities](/editor/extensions/functionality) to the editor. A lot of those extensions bound their commands to common [keyboard shortcuts](/editor/core-concepts/keyboard-shortcuts).

## Vocabulary

ProseMirror has its own vocabulary and you’ll stumble upon all those words now and then. Here is a short overview of the most common words we use in the documentation.

| Word        | Description                                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Schema      | Configures the structure your content can have.                          |
| Document    | The actual content in your editor.                                       |
| State       | Everything to describe the current content and selection of your editor. |
| Transaction | A change to the state (updated selection, content, …)                    |
| Extension   | Registers new functionality.                                             |
| Node        | A type of content, for example a heading or a paragraph.                 |
| Mark        | Can be applied to nodes, for example for inline formatting.              |
| Command     | Execute an action inside the editor, that somehow changes the state.     |
| Decoration  | Styling on top of the document, for example to highlight mistakes.       |
