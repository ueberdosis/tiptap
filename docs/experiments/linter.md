# Linter

⚠️ Experiment, currently not supported or maintained

Linter can be used to check the content as per your wish and highlight it to the user. Linter extension can have multiple plugins for each task you want to achieve.

## Issues
* There is no decoration API in tiptap, that’s why this is a lot of ProseMirror work. Before we’ll publish that example, we’d need to find a few ways to make it more tiptap-like. For example, it would be great to use Vue/React components for the widget.
