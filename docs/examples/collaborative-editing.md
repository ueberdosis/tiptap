# Collaborative editing

## Introduction
This example shows how you can use Tiptap to let multiple users collaborate in the same document in real-time.

It connects all clients to a WebSocket server and merges changes to the document with the power of [Y.js](https://github.com/yjs/yjs). If you want to learn more about collaborative text editing, check out [our guide on collaborative editing](/guide/collaborative-editing).

## Example
:::warning Shared Document
Be nice! The content of this editor is shared with other users from the Internet.

## Backend
In case youâ€™re wondering what kind of sorcery you need on the server to achieve this, here is the whole backend code for the demo:

```js
import { Server } from '@hocuspocus/server'

const server = Server.configure({
  port: 80,
})

server.listen()
```
