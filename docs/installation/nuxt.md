# Nuxt.js

## Introduction
The following guide describes how to integrate Tiptap with your [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) project.

## Requirements
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your machine
* Experience with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/#Getting-Started)

## 1. Create a project (optional)
If you already have an existing Vue project, thatâ€™s fine too. Just skip this step and proceed with the next step.

For the sake of this guide, letâ€™s start with a fresh Nuxt.js project called `tiptap-example`. The following command sets up everything we need. It asks a lot of questions, but just use what floats your boat or use the defaults.

```bash
# create a project
npm init nuxt-app Tiptap-example

# change directory
cd Tiptap-example
```

## 2. Install the dependencies
Okay, enough of the boring boilerplate work. Letâ€™s finally install Tiptap! For the following example youâ€™ll need the `@tiptap/vue-2` package, with a few components, and `@tiptap/starter-kit` which has the most common extensions to get started quickly.

```bash
# install with npm
npm install @tiptap/vue-2 @tiptap/starter-kit

# install with Yarn
yarn add @tiptap/vue-2 @tiptap/starter-kit
```

If you followed step 1 and 2, you can now start your project with `npm run serve` or `yarn serve`, and open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your favorite browser. This might be different, if youâ€™re working with an existing project.

## 3. Create a new component
To actually start using Tiptap, youâ€™ll need to add a new component to your app. Letâ€™s call it `Tiptap` and put the following example code in `src/components/Tiptap.vue`.

This is the fastest way to get Tiptap up and running with Vue. It will give you a very basic version of Tiptap, without any buttons. No worries, you will be able to add more functionality soon.

```html
<template>
  <editor-content :editor="editor" />
</template>

<script>
import { Editor, EditorContent } from '@tiptap/vue-2'
import StarterKit from '@tiptap/starter-kit'

export default {
  components: {
    EditorContent,
  },

  data() {
    return {
      editor: null,
    }
  },

  mounted() {
    this.editor = new Editor({
      content: '<p>Iâ€™m running Tiptap with Vue.js. ðŸŽ‰</p>',
      extensions: [
        StarterKit,
      ],
    })
  },

  beforeDestroy() {
    this.editor.destroy()
  },
}
</script>
```

## 4. Add it to your app
Now, letâ€™s replace the content of `pages/index.vue` with the following example code to use our new `Tiptap` component in our app.

```html
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <client-only>
      <tiptap />
    </client-only>
  </div>
</template>
```

Note that Tiptap needs to run in the client, not on the server. Itâ€™s required to wrap the editor in a `<client-only>` tag. [Read more about cient-only components.](https://nuxtjs.org/api/components-client-only)

You should now see Tiptap in your browser. Time to give yourself a pat on the back! :)

## 5. Use v-model (optional)
Youâ€™re probably used to bind your data with `v-model` in forms, thatâ€™s also possible with Tiptap. Here is a working example component, that you can integrate in your project:
