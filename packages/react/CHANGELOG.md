## 2.6.0

### Minor Changes

- e31673d: This PR significantly improves the performance of React NodeViews in a couple of ways:

  - It now uses useSyncExternalStore to synchronize changes between React & the editor instance
  - It dramatically reduces the number of re-renders by re-using instances of React portals that have already been initialized and unaffected by the change made in the editor

  We were seeing performance problems with React NodeViews because a change to one of them would cause a re-render to all instances of node views. For an application that heavily relies on node views in React, this was quite expensive.
  This should dramatically cut down on the number of instances that have to re-render, and, making each of those re-renders much less costly.

### Patch Changes

- c7fd0f8: Updates the typings to `useEditor` and `EditorProvider` to not conflict with the core Editor type

## 2.5.9

### Patch Changes

- 7c8889a: Optimize `useEditor` and `useEditorState` to reduce number of instances created while still being performant #5432

  The core of this change is two-fold:

  - have the effect run on every render (i.e. without a dep array)
  - schedule destruction of instances, but bail on the actual destruction if the instance was still mounted and a new instance had not been created yet

  It should plug a memory leak, where editor instances could be created but not cleaned up in strict mode.
  As well as fixing a bug where a re-render, with deps, was not applying new options that were set on `useEditor`.

## 2.5.0

### Patch Changes

- fb45149: Fixes strict mode accidentally destroying the editor instance
- fb45149: Fix the typings
- fb45149: We've heard a number of complaints around the performance of our React integration, and we finally have a solution that we believe will satisfy everyone. We've made a number of optimizations to how the editor is rendered, as well give you more control over the rendering process.

  Here is a summary of the changes and how you can take advantage of them:

  - SSR rendering was holding back our ability to have an editor instance on first render of `useEditor`. We've now made the default behavior to render the editor immediately on the client. This behavior can be controlled with the new `immediatelyRender` option which when set to `false` will defer rendering until the second render (via a useEffect), this should only be used when server-side rendering.
  - The default behavior of the useEditor hook is to re-render the editor on every editor transaction. Now with the `shouldRerenderOnTransaction` option, you can disable this behavior to optimize performance. Instead, to access the new editor state, you can use the `useEditorState` hook.
  - `useEditorState` this new hook allows you to select from the editor instance any state you need to render your UI. This is useful when you want to optimize performance by only re-rendering the parts of your UI that need to be updated.

  Here is a usage example:

  ```jsx
  const editor = useEditor({
    /**
     * This option gives us the control to enable the default behavior of rendering the editor immediately.
     */
    immediatelyRender: true,
    /**
     * This option gives us the control to disable the default behavior of re-rendering the editor on every transaction.
     */
    shouldRerenderOnTransaction: false,
    extensions: [StarterKit],
    content: `
      <p>
        A highly optimized editor that only re-renders when it’s necessary.
      </p>
      `,
  });

  /**
   * This hook allows us to select the editor state we want to use in our component.
   */
  const currentEditorState = useEditorState({
    /**
     * The editor instance we want to use.
     */
    editor,
    /**
     * This selector allows us to select the data we want to use in our component.
     * It is evaluated on every editor transaction and compared to it's previously returned value.
     * You can return any data shape you want.
     */
    selector: (ctx) => ({
      isBold: ctx.editor.isActive("bold"),
      isItalic: ctx.editor.isActive("italic"),
      isStrike: ctx.editor.isActive("strike"),
    }),
    /**
     * This function allows us to customize the equality check for the selector.
     * By default it is a `===` check.
     */
    equalityFn: (prev, next) => {
      // A deep-equal function would probably be more maintainable here, but, we use a shallow one to show that it can be customized.
      if (!next) {
        return false;
      }
      return (
        prev.isBold === next.isBold &&
        prev.isItalic === next.isItalic &&
        prev.isStrike === next.isStrike
      );
    },
  });
